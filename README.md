# Follow Up

A project to keep track of links and pages that interest me.

This includes a:

- CDK project for provisioning AWS resources
- [Script Kit](https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit) function for actually saving the links

Currently I have only implemented the functionality of saving but in the future I am interested in ideas like:

- a weekly email of all of the previous week's links
- an email that fetches a random link from the past
